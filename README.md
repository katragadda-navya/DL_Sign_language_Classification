# DL_Sign_language_Classification
PyTorch-based project that trains multiple models (ResNet18, EfficientNet-B0, ViT-B/16) on a 5-class sign language dataset, applies data augmentation to reach 500+ images, and compares inference optimizations (TorchScript, ONNX, INT8) with visual performance results.
